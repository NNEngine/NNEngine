I build and optimize neural-network tooling and numerical libraries — I love to train Deep Neural Networks and turn algorithms into fast, practical code. Focused on low-level numerical libraries (C), Python tooling for data and model workflows, and building reproducible command-line tools. My repositories include BLAS-style vector ops, matrix decomposition code, a CLI-first data-analysis library, and tooling related to LLMs, vector databases and model inference.
